We claim that $f$ is always defined and furthermore, we claim that $f(C) = h(C)$, which we prove by induction on $C$ under the lexicographic ordering of $\\binom{[n]}{k}$. As a base case, $f([k]) = [k+1]$ while the minimum of $g_i([k])$ is attained solely at $i = k+1$ with $g_{k+1}([k]) = -(n-k)$ so $h([k]) = [k+1]$. \\\\\n\nNow consider arbitrary $C \\in \\binom{[n]}{k}$ and assume that for all $D \\in \\binom{[n]}{k}$ with $D < C$, $f(D)$ is well-defined and equal to $h(D)$.

Since $C \\cup \\{r\\}$ must also be attained from $D$ by adding some element, $D$ is of the form $(C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\}$ for some $j > r$ with $j \\in C$. Notice that for $i \\le r$ and $i > j$, $g_i(C) = g_i((C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\})$ while for $r < i \\le j$, $g_i((C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\}) = g_i(C) - 2$. \\\\\n\nLet $m = \\min_{i \\in [n]} g_i(C)$ and $m' = \\min_{i \\in [n]} g_i((C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\})$. By definition of $j$, $m' = g_j((C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\}) = g_j(C) - 2 \\ge (m+1) - 2 = m-1$. Meanwhile, $m' \\le g_{r+1}((C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\}) = g_r((C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\}) - 1 = g_r(C) - 1 = m-1$. Thus $m' = m-1$. \\\\\n\nThen $m-1 = g_j((C \\cup \\{r\\}) \\setminus \\{j\\}) = g_j(C) - 2$. Since $j \\in C$, if $j \\neq n$, then $g_{j+1}(C) = g_j(C) - 1 = m$, contradicting the fact that the largest index for which $m$ is attained by $g_i(C)$ is at $i = r < j$. Otherwise, $j = n$ and $m' = -1$, so that $m = 0$, again a contradiction since $g_1(C) \\le -1$.\\\\\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nFor all $s < r$ with $s \\not \\in C$, $C \\cup \\{s\\}$ is unavailable in sequence $B$ under the operation described in the problem when we reach $C$ in sequence $A$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe will show that for each such $C \\cup \\{s\\}$, there exists $D < C$  such that $f(D) = C \\cup \\{s\\}$. Let $m'' = min_{i \\in [n]} g_i(C \\cup \\{s\\})$ and let $j$ be the smallest index at which $m''$ is attained. Since $s < r$, for $i > s$, $g_i(C) = g_i(C \\cup \\{s\\})$. In particular, for $i > r$, $g_i(C \\cup \\{s\\}) > m$ and $g_r(C \\cup \\{s\\}) = m$. Thus $m'' \\le m$ and $m''$ is attained last at some $t \\le r$. Since $g_i(C) = g_i(C \\cup \\{s\\})$ for $i > s$ and $s < r$, $\\max_{i \\in \\{s+1, \\ldots, n\\}} g_i(C) = m$. Since $g_i(C \\cup \\{s\\}) = g_i(C) + 2$ for $i \\le s$, it follows that $m'' = m$. Thus, since $g_i(C) \\ge m$ always, $g_1(C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\ge m + 2 = m'' + 2 > m''$, i.e. $t > 1$. \\\\\n\n\nWe then claim that $t-1 \\in C \\cup \\{s\\}$, $t -1 \\neq s$, $(C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\} < C$ and that $f((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = C \\cup \\{s\\}$. \\\\\n\nFirst, since $m'' = m$ is minimal and attained at $i = t$, $g_{t-1}(C \\cup \\{s\\}) = 1 + g_t(C \\cup \\{s\\})$, implying that $t-1 \\in C \\cup \\{s\\}$ (since $g_i$ increases by $1$ from $t$ to $t-1$ rather than decreasing by $1$). Since $m'' = m$, $t > s$. Furthermore, since $g_i(C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\ge m+2$ for $i \\le s$ and $g_t(C \\cup \\{s\\}) = t$, then $t-1 > s$ since $g_i$ only ever increases or decreases by $1$ between consecutive values of $i$. Since $t - 1 > s$, $(C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\} < C$. \\\\\n\nFurther, $g_i((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = g_i(C) \\ge m$ for $i > t$. Then $g_{t-1}((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = m - 1$ and $g_i((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = g_i(C) - 2 \\ge (m+1) - 2 = m-1$ for $s < i \\le t-1$. For $i \\le s$, $g_i((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = g_i(C) \\ge m$. Thus, $\\min_{i \\in [n]}g_i((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = m-1$ and the largest index at which it is attained is $t-1$. Thus, by the induction hypothesis, $f((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = h((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t-1\\}) = C \\cup \\{s\\}$. \\\\\n\nMeanwhile, $g_t((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t\\}) = g_i(C) - 2$ for  using the induction hypothesis, $f((C \\cup \\{s\\}) \\setminus \\{t\\})$.\n\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nLemmas $1$ and $2$ together imply that $f(C) = C \\cup \\{r\\}$, completing the induction. \\\\", "date": "10/29/2017", "stwl": "Let $n$ and $k$ be integers with $0 \\le k < \\frac{n}{2}$.
