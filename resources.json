Since $p > 3$ is prime, either $3 \\mid p+1$ or $3 \\mid p-1$. In the first case, set $b_1 = -1$ and in the second case set $b_1 = 1$. For $i \\ge 1$, construct $b_{i+1}$ as follows, having constructed $b_i$ such that $3 \\nmid b_i$, $3 \\mid p-b_i$, and $-\\frac{p}{2} < b_i < \\frac{p}{2}$. \\\\\n\nLet $c_i$ be such that $3^{d_i} c_i = p - b_i$, where $v_3(p-b_i) = d_i$ (i.e. $3 \\nmid c_i$). $d_i \\ge 1$ and $\\frac{p}{2} < p - b_i < \\frac{3p}{2}$ so $0 < c_i < \\frac{p}{2}$.
