{"sol_latex": ["The ordering of the $a_i$ is unimportant, as we can just re-label at the end, so drop this condition (we just need the $a_i$ to be distinct and within the given range). Since $p > 3$ is prime, either $3 \\mid p+1$ or $3 \\mid p-1$. In the first case, set $b_1 = -1$ and in the second case set $b_1 = 1$. For $i \\ge 1$, construct $b_{i+1}$ as follows, having constructed $b_i$ such that $3 \\nmid b_i$, $3 \\mid p-b_i$, and $-\\frac{p}{2} < b_i < \\frac{p}{2}$. \\\\\n\nLet $c_i$ be such that $3^{d_i} c_i = p - b_i$, where $v_3(p-b_i) = d_i$ (i.e. $3 \\nmid c_i$). $d_i \\ge 1$ and $\\frac{p}{2} < p - b_i < \\frac{3p}{2}$ so $0 < c_i < \\frac{p}{2}$. As $3 \\nmid c_i$, either $3 \\mid p + c_i$ or $3 \\mid p - c_i$ (like above). In the first case, set $b_{i+1} = -c_i$ and in the second case set $b_{i+1} = c_i$. (From the way $b_1$ was defined, $c_0 = 1$.) \\\\\n\nHaving constructed the $b_i$ in this way, there will exist some smallest $j \\ge 2$ such that $b_j = b_k$ for some $k < j$ (i.e. we will enter a cycle, possibly pure), since all $b_i$ are drawn from the finite set $\\{-\\frac{p-1}{2}, -\\frac{p-3}{2}, \\ldots, \\frac{p-3}{2}, \\frac{p-1}{2}\\}$. Set $a_1 = b_k, a_2 = b_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_{j-k} = b_{j-1}$. By minimality of $j$, these $a_i$ are distinct, lie in the range, and give the above product as:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(p-a_1)(p-a_2)\\cdots (p-a_n)}{|a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n|} &= \\frac{3^{d_{k}} c_{k}}{c_{k-1}} \\cdot \\frac{3^{d_{k+1}}c_{k+1}}{c_k} \\cdot \\text{ } \\cdots \\text{ } \\cdot \\frac{3^{d_{j-1}}c_{j-1}}{c_{j-2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3^{d_k + d_{k+1} + \\cdots + d_{j-1}}c_{j-1}}{c_{k-1}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3^{d_k + d_{k+1} + \\cdots + d_{j-1}}c_{k-1}}{c_{k-1}} \\\\\n&= 3^{d_k + d_{k+1} + \\cdots + d_{j-1}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo this choice of $a_i$s satisfies all conditions.\n"], "statements": ["Let $p$ be a prime greater than $3$.
